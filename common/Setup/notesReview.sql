I am afraid to continue with this system per my last patient told me he is afraid that \"we might get sued by someone\".  Please get back to me about this as soon as possible.

Thank you, Alicia Kennedy, DDSJim\'s response:Hello,Since the gel is not supposed to touch the lips at all,  my guess is perhaps the patients lips are touching the shealth that was recently wiped down with a Cavi wipe? It\'s just a guess...However, as you know the Cavi wipes should not come into contact with the skin. You can use them however, you just need to wipe them down with a mild soap and water before the treatment.  Otherwise, you can use another disinfectant that is safe on the skin.Likely this is the case with the swelling of the lips.  All our gels are tested regularly and are at the sales 25%CP.

Amanda helped me with some trouble shooting and she feels that we need a new light. When we had this problem before, we were sent replacement parts, and it worked for a little while, but now we are having the same issues.  Amanda told me that by my description of the light, we have the “old” version. First, the timer display stopped working, then the light started flashing, and then the entire light stopped working all together. Dr. Hauser is running a whitening special right now for summer and we need the light to be in good working order ASAP. Please contact me at the number below.

Linda I believe you are my territory rep, because you were the closest region to me. We’ve been using Sinsational Smile for the past year now and have gotten pretty good results. Unfortunately, the last batch we ordered (via Henry Schien) we’ve ran into some issues. I’ve only used two from this batch, but both patients had blanched gums and a burned inner lip. One patient had to take severe medication to come down her sensitive teeth and the other had a swollen lip for the entire following day. The application on our end was not done any differently than with any other sensational packages. Is there something you guys have done different on your end? Possibly added more gel to the tray or are inserting the bleach with a greater height than before causing the material to also cover the gums and overfill into the lip area? Is there something we should be doing differently and do you have any recommendations? We are very concerned about this new batch and are quite honestly nervous to keep using it.

He didn\'t whiten much and his front office manager didn\'t whiten much (1 tray treatment each) however their first patient they used Sinsational Smile on did whiten 2 shades with one (1) tray and was very happy. He says he\'s going to keep me posted with their results however he asked \"if I\'m not happy I\'m going to return this ... rights Walter?\"2. The contact person to help them get all the Social Media Stuff going and the promotional things going isn\'t calling them back. I asked if its Deanne he said no it\'s someone else who Deanne told me to call of which he can\'t recall however their voice mail recording definitely said Sinsational Smile so Dr. Pham is sure he has the correct number? Can someone call Dr. Pham at office 1(619)421-2155 and then email me confirming they called this way I can share we are on it.3.

I tried a tube and it lasted me 1 week also,I’m not sure if there is less in the tube cause I’ve had a pen last me for 2 months.I’ve replaced the pens to each patient because I feel reliable to help them.They were all instructed how to use it. We have been doing this since February and this is the firstTime we are having complains on the take home kit.Please advise.  Ginger Kaila (office Manager for Dr. Theiss)Conrad C. Theiss DMD Inc. ~ Implant Center of Maui33 Lono Avenue, suite 210 ~ Kahului, HI 96732Phone: 808-877-3605 ~ Fax: 808-871-7446Non Doctor or Patient’s Email to: implantcenterofmaui@gmail.comHi Ginger,I am sorry to hear that  there are problems with patients using the whitening pens and the gel only lasting 2 weeks.  Please make sure patients are not expressing too much of the gel out each time they use it.  The bristles just need to be lightly saturated so that the patient can apply a thin layer on the facials of their anterior teeth.  We did send your office 6 replacement whitening pens in June for the same issue.  We will send you 6 more replacements again at no charge.  If there are any questions,  I would be more than happy to review the correct use and amount of gel needed for the whitening pens with your staff.Thank you!Christine Schoffstall, RDH800-407-6820christine@sinsationalsmile.com  Sinsational Smile, IncA Yes I did receive that for the first order.I had a Patterson rep in my office today.She mentioned that another office mentioned it to her too.

We are sad to say that we will be ending our relationship with you all as it seems as though you have changed something in the product since our last order.  We have been using the 25% carbomide peroxide for over a year now and all of a sudden with this latest order we have seen lots of blanching in the gums.

I\'m in need of some assistance with a few trays we have. I\'ll attach some pictures so you can see what I\'m referring too. We have 5 trays that are from a refill kit we ordered in January 2016. The trays are always kept in the refrigerator when they are not out and expected to be used during the day. After our last patient leaves, we\'ll put the trays back in the fridge and we never have more than 2 out at a time. These 5 trays have turned a weird \"yellowy\" color. I\'m not going to say that the entire refill kit wasn\'t like this, but I feel I would have noticed it. Can you give me some insight on what may have happened to these trays? Are they still save to use? A few patients that had used some of the discolored trays complained afterwards of sensitivity around gum line and an almost burning sensation. We gave the Rincinol samples thinking it was just one of the side effects from the whitening in general. We\'ve since ordered another refill kit and have the new trays (you can see in the pic.) We haven\'t had any issues nor complaints with these. We LOVE the new design! Makes is so easy to line up with the light! So, any help or insight you can give on these other \"odd duck\" trays would be greatly appreciated! I will also be attaching a picture of the expiration date along with the Lot #. I hope this will help. You can reach me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you!
